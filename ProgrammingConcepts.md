1. Shapes

Well I made all the models except background_image from what I learned in class.
(like rect(20,20,100,) )

2. Colors

I tried not to use dark colors for the background as much as much as I could.
Most of the designs were white and provided transparency so that the background_image could be seen.

3. Variables

4. Conditional Statements

5. Loops

I used Loops with a for() statement to increase with the number of Note arrays. (Note_Spawn 1 , Note_Spawn 2)

6. Functions

sketch.js 


7. Classes

Arrays
